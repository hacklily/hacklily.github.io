            <li>
                Songs you save are shared <strong>publically</strong> using GitHub and GitHub Pages. (See <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">GitHub's privacy statement</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Sheet music you enter into Hacklily is rendered on a server I run, and may be stored for debugging for up to 7 days. Aggregate information
            may be stored for longer for analytics and performance monitoring.</li>

    <h2>Privacy officer</h2>
    I am Joshua Netterfield. I operate the https://hacklily.org website ("Hacklily") and am the privacy officer.
    You can reach me at joshua@nettek.ca.

    <h2>Information collection and use</h2>
    <p>
    While using Hacklily, you may log in using GitHub. If you do so, you will provide me with certain personally
    identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include,
    but is not limited to, your name, GitHub username, and email address ("Personal Information").
    </p>
    <p>
    This Personal Information is used to run Hacklily, as well as for analytics and debugging. I will not contact you
    except as needed to run Hacklily effectively. I will not share your Personal Information with third parties except as
    needed to run Hacklily or use it to send you promotional messages.
    </p>

    <h2>Log data</h2>
    <p>
    LilyPond source entered in Hacklily is rendered using a copy of LilyPond running on a server. I may store a copy of songs
    source, the output, as well as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser type, browser
    version, and your Personal Information.
    </p>
    <p>
    The songs themselves along with any associated Personal Information will be used for providing you with the service, as
    well as for debugging and may be stored for up to 7 days. Aggregate or anonymized information may be kept
    longer for analytics, so that (for example) I know how many monthly active users I have. I may share aggregate information
    with third parties.
    </p>
    <h2>

    <h2>DOM storage</h2>
    I use DOM Storage (a technology similar to cookies) to store unsaved versions of your songs as well
    as Personal Information on your computer, even once you close Hacklily. DOM Storage must be enabled to log in via GitHub
    or store unsaved versions of songs. You can remove this information by logging out using the menu.

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    This site is hosted using GitHub Pages. GitHub may store your IP address and other Personal Information when you access
    Hacklily.

    <p>
    By connecting Hacklily to GitHub, you agree to GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/"
    >privacy statement</a>. Connecting Hacklily to GitHub allows you to save, store, and publish songs on GitHub and
    GitHub Pages.
    </p>

    <p>
    Everything you save on Hacklily will be publically viewable in Hacklily and under your GitHub account.
    It will be publically stored on a GitHub repo associated with your GitHub account (and username) in the <code>sheet-music</code> repository associated with your
    account.
    All history will be stored. You can delete your history by deleting your <code>sheet-music </code>repository on
    GitHub.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    I try my best, but I cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal Information.

    <h2>Links To Other Sites</h2>
    If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. You might want to review the Privacy
    Statement of every site you visit.

    <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
    Hacklily does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").

    I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are
    aware that your Children has provided Hacklily with Personal Information, please contact me. If I discover that a Children under 13 has provided
    me with Personal Information, I will delete such information from our servers immediately.

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h2>
    <p>
    Hacklily's privacy statement may change without notice. Changes are effective when they are posted on this website.
